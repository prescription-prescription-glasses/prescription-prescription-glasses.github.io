<h3>My Nightmare Glasses Purchase: Defective Coating & Disappointing Customer Service! 😡</h3>
<p></br>
I’m writing this as a cautionary tale about my terrible online shopping experience. Everything about working with this company was great until the glasses defect surfaced. I paid for premium lenses, including a $48 extra for the Super Hydrophobic coating, and now these lenses are nearly impossible to clean. I’ve worn glasses for 60 years and have 9 pairs from another company without this issue, so I know this isn’t a user error. It’s clearly a defect, yet I was only offered a 50% store credit under their "365-day warranty." My inability to get them clean is extremely frustrating, and I feel compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service to seek a proper resolution: a replacement pair with the Super Hydrophobic treatment applied correctly, as I was told it would take 3 to 5 days to even get an email from their review team.</p>
<p>Customer: My new glasses are impossible to clean, despite paying extra for the Super Hydrophobic coating. I've worn glasses for decades, and these are constantly smudged, unlike any other pair I own.
CS Rep: I understand how frustrating it must be to have difficulty cleaning your new glasses, especially after opting for a premium coating. I sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. Could you please confirm your order number so I can look into this for you?
Customer: It's Order #105180754. This is clearly a defect, yet when I spoke to someone earlier, I was only offered a 50% store credit if I return them. I just want a replacement pair with the coating applied correctly.
CS Rep: Thank you for providing the order number. I see your previous interaction. I apologize that the initial resolution wasn't satisfactory. I'm escalating this to our review team for a reassessment of the warranty claim, specifically focusing on a replacement for the defective coating. Please expect an email with an update within 3-5 business days.
Customer: Waiting 3 to 5 days for an email after already having issues and being offered only half credit is not ideal. It's truly disappointing, I need glasses I can actually see through.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap with defective products and difficult warranty processes.

My last online shopping experience for glasses was a complete disaster! 😤 I paid extra for a 'Super Hydrophobic' coating, but the lenses were impossible to clean, constantly smudged. After decades of wearing glasses, I knew it wasn't user error; it was a clear defect. Yet, the company only offered a paltry 50% store credit and made me wait days just for an email from their 'review team.' It was incredibly frustrating and utterly disappointing. I just needed glasses I could actually see through, not a constant battle with smudges and bad customer service. 😭</p>
<p>After such a terrible ordeal, I was hesitant to buy glasses online again, but I desperately needed a new pair and couldn't face another frustrating in-store search. That's when I decided to give cinily.net a try, hoping for a smoother, more reliable experience. 🤔</p>
<p>I was relieved to find that my experience with cinily.net was completely different. I even found a review saying, "I ordered these glasses for my husband. They were 1/2 the cost of the ones from the Eye Doctor and I was able to get them without bifocals and a nicer frame. I highly recommend blingcharming." My own experience echoed this positivity! The ordering process was incredibly straightforward, and their customer service was attentive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous nightmare. The quality of their frames is fantastic, and the lenses are crystal clear – finally, glasses I can actually see through! ✨ I was specifically looking for <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">affordable prescription glasses</a>, and cinily.net delivered beyond my expectations in terms of both price and quality. The value for money is exceptional, and the entire transaction felt seamless and trustworthy. I'm so glad I gave them a chance! 😃</p>
