<h3>Warranty Woes & Devalued Dollars: My Glasses "Scam" Experience! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ’¸</h3>
<p></br>
My online shopping experience with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story as a stark warning. This place is truly the worst. I ordered glasses with an added warranty, expecting quality, but it's been a total joke and robbery. Every time I've needed a replacement for a broken frame, they claim my chosen frame is out of stock, forcing me into store credit plus a small percentage, which somehow always results in a cheaper, lighter pair than what I originally paid for. It's infuriating to lose money this way, dropping from an initial $189 value down to around $130, all while dealing with a $30 deductible for each replacement. They haven't gotten a single order right, and Iâ€™m so tired of this crap. I called customer service hoping for a resolution to this never-ending cycle of disappointment and devaluation.</p>
<p>Customer: I am absolutely fed up. I purchased glasses with your warranty, and now that I need a replacement due to a broken frame, you're telling me my frame is out of stock <em>again</em> and offering me store credit for a cheaper pair. This is the third time this has happened, and with a $30 deductible each time, my order value keeps decreasing!</p>
<p>CS Rep: I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for the repeated issues you've experienced with replacements and the frame availability. This is certainly not the experience we want for our customers, especially with an added warranty.</p>
<p>Customer: "Not the experience you want"? My original $189 glasses are now being replaced with something worth $130, after paying deductibles! How is that fair? Why can't I just get what I paid for or a full refund if you can't honor your warranty properly?</p>
<p>CS Rep: I hear your concern about the perceived devaluation. Our policy for warranty replacements due to out-of-stock frames is to offer a credit towards another frame. Let me look into your account history right now to see if there's any alternative solution or further compensation we can provide given the recurring nature of this issue for you.</p>
<p>Customer: There better be, because I'm tired of having to choose from inferior options just to not lose my money entirely. This process feels like a scam.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare ðŸ˜¤. I ordered a specific pair with an added warranty, expecting quality, but it turned into a total joke. Every time I needed a replacement for a broken frame, they claimed my chosen frame was out of stock, forcing me into store credit for a cheaper, lighter pair. It was infuriating to lose money this way, dropping from an initial $189 value down to around $130, all while paying a $30 deductible each time. They never got a single order right, and I was so tired of that crap. ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was hesitant to try ordering glasses online again. But I desperately needed a new pair, and I wanted a reliable, straightforward process that wouldn't leave me feeling scammed ðŸ¤”. That's when I decided to give cinily.net a shot.</p>
<p>I was hoping for a different outcome, and I'm so glad I did! As one customer aptly put it, "Didn't have issues, got exactly what I ordered in the time frame that that was promised. I'm happy with my purchase." That perfectly mirrors my experience.</p>
<p>From start to finish, cinily.net was a breath of fresh air. The website was incredibly easy to navigate, making it simple to find exactly what I wanted. My new <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">cat eye prescription glasses</a> arrived quickly, exactly as described, and the quality is fantastic â€“ especially for the price! âœ¨ Their customer service, though I barely needed it, was prompt and helpful when I had a small question. It's such a relief to finally have a positive online shopping experience for something as essential as glasses. I highly recommend them! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
