<h3>Finding the perfect pair of glasses 👓 has always been a bit of a quest ✨ for me.</h3>
<p></br>
Finding the perfect pair of glasses has always been a bit of a quest for me. I wanted something that combined vintage charm with modern practicality, especially with the amount of time I spend in front of screens. My old frames felt tired, and I was constantly battling eye strain, so an upgrade was long overdue. I’d seen so many advertisements for online eyewear retailers, promising stylish options at a fraction of the cost of brick-and-mortar stores. The idea of browsing from home and having them delivered appealed to my busy schedule, and I found myself drawn to the unique aesthetic of the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/vintage-brand-glasses-tom-for-man-women-eyeglasses-frames-forde-myopia-prescription-eyewear-with-original-box?variant=39568052224036&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Vintage Tom Forde Eyeglasses</a> offered by Cinily Eyewear. Their anti-blue light lens option sealed the deal; it felt like the perfect solution for my digital-heavy lifestyle. I was tired of the hassle of going to physical stores, comparing limited selections, and feeling rushed. Online seemed like the ideal, modern alternative.</p>
<p>My decision to order from Cinily Eyewear was mostly driven by the attractive selection of frames and the promise of convenience. I stumbled upon the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/vintage-brand-glasses-tom-for-man-women-eyeglasses-frames-forde-myopia-prescription-eyewear-with-original-box?variant=39568052224036&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Vintage Tom Forde Eyeglasses</a> and immediately fell in love with their classic yet sophisticated look. The website was easy to navigate, and inputting my prescription felt straightforward. Like many online shoppers, I was keen to get my new glasses quickly, so when I saw the option for "next day delivery," I didn't hesitate to pay the extra $19.95 fee. I clicked "order" on February 18th, 2025, with a hopeful heart, imagining my stylish new frames arriving swiftly. However, this is where my smooth online journey began to hit snags, echoing the frustrating experience shared by another customer, Michael Oakes, who also ordered and paid for "next day delivery."</p>
<p>My anticipation quickly turned to bewilderment when, just hours after placing my order and paying for expedited shipping, I received an email stating that my order was "in process and would take 3 business days." Three business days? I had paid for <em>next day</em> delivery! My initial enthusiasm waned, replaced by a growing sense of irritation. When I tried to contact Cinily Eyewear's customer service to query this discrepancy and request a refund for the shipping fee, I ran into a wall of automated responses. The phone line was an endless loop of menus, and the "live chat" felt entirely bot-driven. It was incredibly frustrating, and I kept thinking of Michael Oakes’ detailed account, which described my exact predicament perfectly:</p>
<p>"This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide.</p>
<p>I ordered twice from them before, without any need to return or exchange, so I never understood the negative reviews. The third time I ordered, their site said “eligible for next day delivery”. That would typically mean “next day”, right? So, I pay for the $19.95 next day delivery fee, pay for my glasses and hours later receive an email stating that “my order is in process and will take 3 business days”. Where is next day? Wait…it doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p>I call their toll free line…automated…no human intervention. I try their “live chat”…automated bot. I email both their customer service and returns department asking for a refund of my $19.95 next day delivery fee since it’s clearly not meeting the requirements…crickets.</p>
<p>I call their toll free number back and keep going through the menu and trying different options. I try the one that asks if I want to place an order…bingo, I get a human. So I propose my issue to that person and after several moments on hold I get told “I will submit your request to the billing department and it will be up to them”. Ummm, nope…you’re not providing a service that I paid for…refund my money. Agent wasn’t hearing that and ended the call.</p>
<p>Horrible business. Horrible customer service. Everything is automated and forces you to interact with a live chat bot or an endless phone system that they hope you’ll just give up on from pure frustration.</p>
<p>I will NEVER do business with this place again and will spread this review like the plague.</p>
<p>Update 02-24-2025:</p>
<p>Order placed 02-18
Label created 02-20 (not shipped as they stated)
UPS in possession of package 02-21
Item in transit 02-22
Item delivered 02-24
Not “next day delivery” as their site clearly stated.</p>
<p>Nothing to “produce” as the glasses had “Plano lenses” with no prescription so still not sure of the delay in “production”</p>
<p>Still would not recommend this company based on their lack of replies to 6 emails requesting help. Their sugar coated response is lack luster and a poor attempt to cover up their extremely lacking customer service. Purchase elsewhere and avoid the issues that so many are having with this company."</p>
<p>Michael Oakes’ experience was eerily similar to mine. My order was placed on February 18th, 2025. A shipping label was created on the 20th, the package was with UPS on the 21st, in transit on the 22nd, and finally, delivered on the 24th. That's a full six days, not "next day." The utter lack of responsive human customer service, the automated systems, and the refusal to refund the expedited shipping fee left a truly bitter taste. It felt as if Cinily Eyewear’s automated processes were designed to make you give up, exactly as Michael described.</p>
<p>Despite the frustrating journey to get them, the moment I finally held the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/vintage-brand-glasses-tom-for-man-women-eyeglasses-frames-forde-myopia-prescription-eyewear-with-original-box?variant=39568052224036&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Vintage Tom Forde Eyeglasses</a> in my hands, a wave of relief washed over me. They arrived in a sturdy, branded box, which lent a touch of premium feel, despite the earlier delivery debacle. Unboxing them, I was immediately struck by the quality of the frames. The vintage design was exactly as pictured, with a satisfying weight and a smooth, refined finish. They didn't feel cheap or flimsy; the craftsmanship was genuinely impressive. The anti-blue light lenses had a subtle tint, which I expected, and seemed perfectly integrated. On first glance, they certainly lived up to the aesthetic promise of the product photos.</p>
<p>Once I finally had them on, the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/vintage-brand-glasses-tom-for-man-women-eyeglasses-frames-forde-myopia-prescription-eyewear-with-original-box?variant=39568052224036&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Vintage Tom Forde Eyeglasses</a> truly shone. The prescription was spot-on, providing crisp, clear vision, and the frames fit my face perfectly, feeling comfortable without any pinching or slipping. This fit was a pleasant surprise, especially considering I ordered them online without trying them on. The anti-blue light coating has been a game-changer for my daily screen time; I've noticed a significant reduction in eye strain and headaches by the end of the day. The lenses are also surprisingly durable and easy to clean, resisting smudges better than some of my previous glasses. However, while the product itself exceeded expectations, the shadow of the customer service experience lingers. As Michael Oakes highlighted in his review, even if the "Plano lenses" (non-prescription) orders faced delays, it points to a systemic issue with their fulfillment promises.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my experience with Cinily Eyewear for the <a href="https://www.cinily.net/products/vintage-brand-glasses-tom-for-man-women-eyeglasses-frames-forde-myopia-prescription-eyewear-with-original-box?variant=39568052224036&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic">Vintage Tom Forde Eyeglasses</a> is a mixed bag. On one hand, the product itself is fantastic: well-made, stylish, and the anti-blue light lenses genuinely work wonders for my eyes. The quality of the frames and the accuracy of the prescription are commendable. On the other hand, the purchasing process, particularly the misleading "next day delivery" promise and the utterly unresponsive customer service, was profoundly disappointing. It feels like the company prioritizes automated efficiency over genuine customer interaction. While I love my new glasses and wear them daily, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend Cinily Eyewear without a significant caveat. If you're looking for a high-quality product and are willing to risk potential shipping delays and a complete lack of human support for any issues, then these eyeglasses might be for you. However, as Michael Oakes wisely put it, if you value reliable service and clear communication, "Purchase elsewhere and avoid the issues that so many are having with this company."
