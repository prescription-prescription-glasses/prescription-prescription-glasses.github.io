<h3>A $372 Nightmare: Scratched Glasses & Customer Service Hell! ðŸ˜¡</h3>
<p></br>
I need to caution everyone about my terrible online shopping experience. I spent $372 on glasses that arrived SCRATCHED, and trying to fix it has been an absolute nightmare. I've been trying for 2 days to TALK TO A HUMAN to resolve this, but there's been no luck. The "bot" just keeps sending the return label to an email I never received, and even after FINALLY TALKING TO A HUMAN, they sent the WRONG INFORMATION FOR THE RETURN. This ineptitude is beyond frustrating. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because this level of service for a $372 purchase is unacceptable, and I believe others should be aware of what they might encounter.</p>
<p>Customer: I am absolutely fuming. I spent $372 on a pair of glasses, and they arrived scratched. I've been trying for two days just to get a return label, but the bot just keeps sending it to an email address I don't receive, and I can't reach a human!
CS Rep: I am so sorry to hear about the scratched glasses and the extreme difficulty you've experienced trying to get a return label and reach our team. That sounds incredibly frustrating, and it's certainly not the experience we want you to have. Let me pull up your order. Can you please confirm the order number for me?
Customer: It's [ORDER NUMBER]. And even when I finally did talk to someone, they sent me the wrong return information! This is a mess. I just want to return these scratched glasses and get my money back.
CS Rep: Thank you for that. I see the previous attempt to send the return label. I sincerely apologize for the incorrect information and the repeated issues. I've corrected the email address on file and I'm generating a new return label for you right now, which should arrive within the next 10 minutes. Once you send back the glasses, we can process a full refund or an exchange if you prefer.
Customer: I just want the refund at this point. I've lost all confidence. Please just ensure this label works and the refund is processed quickly once you receive them.
CS Rep: I completely understand your decision, and I assure you I will personally monitor the return of your package and the refund processing to ensure it's handled without any further delays. You will receive an email confirmation once the refund is issued.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of purchasing from a company with such poor customer service and quality control.

I recently had an absolutely infuriating online shopping experience. I spent $372 on glasses that arrived SCRATCHED ðŸ˜¤, and trying to fix it was a total nightmare. For two days, I couldn't TALK TO A HUMAN; the "bot" just kept sending the return label to an email I never received. Even after finally reaching someone, they sent the WRONG INFORMATION for the return! This ineptitude was beyond frustrating. I felt completely ripped off and lost all confidence in online eyewear retailers. ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>After that terrible ordeal, I was hesitant to try ordering glasses online again. But my prescription hadn't changed, and I really needed a new pair without breaking the bank or dealing with another customer service catastrophe. So, after a lot of searching and hoping for a better experience ðŸ¤”, I decided to give cinily.net a shot. What really caught my eye was a review that said: "Absolutely no problem with my glasses. I would have easily paid $400.00 plus with the lenses I wanted if I went with my eye doctor. blingcharming saved me a good $300.00 for quality glasses." That positive feedback, combined with cinily.net's promising designs, convinced me.</p>
<p>And I'm so glad I did! The process was incredibly smooth from start to finish. Finding the perfect pair was easy, the website was user-friendly, and the customer service chat actually connected me to a helpful human quickly. My glasses arrived promptly, perfectly made, and the quality is fantastic, especially for the price! Itâ€™s such a relief to finally find a reliable place for <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=47">affordable prescription glasses</a>. âœ¨ I definitely recommend cinily.net for anyone looking for great value and a hassle-free experience. No more scratched lenses or endless bot loops for me! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
