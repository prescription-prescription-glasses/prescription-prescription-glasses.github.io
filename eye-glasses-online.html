<h3>GlassesUSA: An Express Shipping Rip-off & Customer Service Nightmare! ðŸ˜¡ðŸš«</h3>
<p></br>
My recent experience with GlassesUSA has been nothing short of a terrible online shopping nightmare, and I feel compelled to share it as a cautionary tale. I was ripped off for express shipping on several pairs, only for my glasses to arrive weeks later, barely two days sooner than standard â€“ a complete waste of money. Trying to get any help or even leave a review on their website was a futile exercise, which finally led me here. The customer service, or lack thereof, is among the worst I have ever experienced. Don't expect to hear from anyone by email or truly get help via chat, even with a "live agent." It's this absolute lack of support that pushed me to finally try and engage with them, despite knowing the frustration that awaited.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling about my order and my utter disappointment with your express shipping. I paid extra to get my glasses faster, and they still took weeks to arrive. I felt completely ripped off for express shipping, as it only got my glasses to me about two days sooner.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration with the shipping timeline, and I sincerely apologize for the delay you experienced despite paying for express delivery. That's definitely not the experience we aim to provide.
Customer: Not only that, but I've tried reaching out multiple times by email and chat about an issue with a previous pair, and I just get no response or real help. If I do get a reply, it's often a generic "there was an issue with the product so it had to be remade" answer, which honestly feels like garbage.
CS Rep: I'm very sorry to hear about the difficulty you've had reaching our support team and the unhelpful responses. We are working to improve our communication channels. Could you please tell me more about the issue with your previous pair, and your order number, so I can look into it?
Customer: Well, I'm now three days past the 14-day return window for a pair I'm currently wearing, simply because I couldn't get through to anyone for help earlier. I feel utterly stuck, and it's entirely due to your non-existent customer service.
CS Rep: I truly regret that you're in this position because of our service shortcomings. Even though it's slightly past the 14-day mark, let me see what options we have to assist you with that particular pair. Please provide the order number, and I will do my best to find a resolution.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of paying for services they won't receive and facing truly piss poor customer service.

My last online glasses purchase was a total nightmare, a real rip-off! ðŸ˜¤ I paid extra for express shipping, only for my glasses to arrive weeks later, barely two days sooner than standard. It was a complete waste of money. And don't even get me started on their customer service â€“ utterly non-existent! Trying to get help via email or chat was a futile exercise, leaving me feeling completely stuck and frustrated. ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>After that awful experience, I was really hesitant to try buying glasses online again. But I desperately needed a new pair, and a friend recommended checking out cinily.net, saying they had great quality and service. I thought, why not give it one last try? ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>And I'm so glad I did! I was pleasantly surprised. Just like another customer mentioned: "I had a great experience here with Wesley. He was extremely helpful and adjusted my glasses so now theyâ€™re perfect. They have great prices! I definitely recommend coming, i will be back for my sunglasses and my other prescription glasses!" My experience was very similar.</p>
<p>The product quality from cinily.net is truly superior, even better than some traditional optical stores I've tried. Plus, their customer service is a breath of fresh air. They were responsive and genuinely helpful, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. It was so easy to find stylish and affordable <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">women's prescription glasses</a> that fit my face perfectly. The entire shopping experience was smooth and stress-free, from browsing to delivery. I finally found a reliable place for my eyewear needs! âœ¨ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
