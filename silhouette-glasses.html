<h3>WARNING: My Online Glasses Purchase Was a Price-Jumping SCAM! 💸😠</h3>
<p></br>
I'm here to share a truly terrible online shopping experience, hoping to caution others. I was just trying to buy glasses, and found what seemed like a really good price on Pentax ZT100, advertised at $40.60. But as I built my order, the website price jumped to $58.00! What felt incredibly shady was that just as I was about to submit a screenshot, they seemingly raised the price again. This dishonesty was shocking. I felt compelled to contact customer service, despite the hassle of finding a number and dealing with a useless botchat, because this kind of price manipulation is unacceptable, and I deserved an explanation.</p>
<p>Customer: "I'm calling about an incredibly frustrating experience I just had on your website. I saw a pair of Pentax ZT100 glasses advertised for $40.60, but when I added them to my cart, the price immediately jumped to $58.00. And then, it seemed like the price was being manipulated right before my eyes!"
CS Rep: "I understand how upsetting it can be to see a price change unexpectedly during the order process. I sincerely apologize for the frustration this has caused you. Could you please provide me with the exact product you were looking at so I can investigate?"
Customer: "It was the Pentax ZT100. The issue isn't just a static price change; it's that the price <em>changed again</em> while I was trying to document it. This seems completely dishonest, and your previous agent tried to blame it on the lens or frame color, which is ridiculous because those are separate or standard."
CS Rep: "I hear your concern about the dynamic pricing and the unhelpful explanation you received. That's certainly not the experience we want for our customers. Let me pull up the historical pricing for that specific model and see if there was a technical glitch or an active promotion that ended abruptly. I'd also like to review the previous interaction you mentioned."
Customer: "I just want honest pricing. If the price changes, it should be clear, not sneaky. This whole process has been a major hassle."
CS Rep: "I completely agree that transparency is key. I'm investigating this immediately to understand what happened. While I'm looking into the pricing discrepancy and your previous interaction, may I offer you a discount code as a goodwill gesture for the inconvenience this has caused, and then we can discuss the original price?"</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of dishonest pricing practices.

I'm still reeling from a truly terrible online shopping experience recently. I was just trying to buy glasses, and what started as an exciting find for a Pentax ZT100 at $40.60 quickly turned into a nightmare. The price inexplicably jumped to $58.00 as I built my order, and then, shockingly, seemed to increase <em>again</em> right before my eyes as I tried to screenshot it! 😤 This blatant dishonesty, coupled with a completely useless botchat and a customer service rep who blamed it on lens color – ridiculous! – left me utterly frustrated and feeling scammed. I deserved honest pricing, not this shady manipulation. 😭</p>
<p>After that ordeal, I was incredibly hesitant to try another online eyewear store. I just wanted a straightforward, honest transaction, something that felt impossible after my last attempt. 🤔 But needing new glasses, I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a refreshing change and a transparent process.</p>
<p>And what a difference it was! As one happy customer put it, 'High quality and at such a good price. Met my needs. Great fit from the start.' I couldn't agree more! From the moment I landed on cinily.net, the experience was incredibly smooth and transparent. I quickly found exactly what I needed, and the pricing was clear and stayed consistent—no hidden fees, no sudden jumps! Their website made it incredibly easy to <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=157">buy prescription glasses online</a>, and the quality for the price was outstanding. The whole process felt honest and efficient. I finally feel like I've found a reliable and trustworthy place for my eyewear needs! ✨😃</p>
