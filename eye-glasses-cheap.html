<h3>WARNING ⚠️: My "Next Day Delivery" Was a $19.95 Rip-Off & Customer Service Nightmare! 😤</h3>
<p></br>
I recently had a terrible online shopping experience that I feel compelled to share as a warning. This place is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services that they charge for and do NOT provide. I paid for "next day delivery," which usually means next day, right? But after paying the $19.95 fee, I got an email saying my order would take 3 business days! This blatant disregard for their own promises forced me to try and reach customer service, hoping for a simple refund for a service I clearly wouldn't receive.</p>
<p>Customer: Hello, I need to speak to someone about my recent order. I paid for next-day delivery, but my order confirmation says it will take 3 business days. I want a refund for the $19.95 delivery fee.
CS Rep: I understand you're calling about your delivery. Let me pull up your order with your order number. Could you please provide it for me?
Customer: Yes, it's [Order Number]. I paid for next-day delivery because I needed these glasses quickly, and now I'm being told it won't arrive for days. This isn't what I paid for.
CS Rep: Thank you. I see your order here. I apologize for the confusion regarding the delivery timeframe. Sometimes, even with expedited shipping, processing can take an additional day or two depending on the product.
Customer: But your website explicitly said “eligible for next day delivery,” and I paid extra for that. An email later saying “3 business days” is unacceptable. I just want my $19.95 back for a service you're not providing.
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration. While the "next day" option applies to the shipping method itself once it leaves our facility, there is often a production or processing time before shipment. I can submit a request to our billing department regarding a refund for the expedited shipping fee, but it will be up to them to approve.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and paying for services that are never delivered.

I recently had a truly terrible online shopping experience that left me completely frustrated 😤. I paid extra for "next day delivery" expecting my glasses quickly, but after a $19.95 fee, I got an email saying my order would take <em>three business days</em>! Their customer service was a nightmare, just automated responses and no real help for a refund. It felt like a total fraud, ripping me off for a service they never provided 😭.</p>
<p>After that, I was really hesitant to trust any online eyewear store again 🤔. But I desperately needed new glasses, and I kept seeing positive mentions of cinily.net. I decided to give them a try, hoping for a smoother, more honest experience.</p>
<p>I remembered reading a review, "I’ve been using blingcharming for a couple years now. I’ve purchased about 4-5 glasses in total, my husband has gotten about 3, and we’ve had zero issues. Their prices are so affordable and so cute! I always get so many compliments with my glasses. Will continue purchasing with blingcharming." This gave me a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>From the moment I landed on cinily.net, the experience was completely different. The website was so easy to navigate, and finding the perfect pair was a breeze. I was specifically searching for <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=125">affordable prescription glasses</a>, and cinily.net truly delivered! The frames feel high-quality, and the lenses are perfectly clear. Their customer service was actually responsive and helpful, a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. Plus, the prices were incredibly fair, offering exceptional value for money ✨. My order arrived exactly as promised, without any hidden delays or automated runarounds. I'm so happy I took a chance on them. It truly made up for my past disappointment! 😃</p>
