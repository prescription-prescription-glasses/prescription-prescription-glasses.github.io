<h3>WARNING: My $19.95 'Next-Day' Delivery Was a Total Scam! ðŸ˜¡</h3>
<p></br>
Let me tell you about a terrible online shopping experience that I hope serves as a warning to others. This company is nothing more than an automated business that cares nothing about its customers. They are a fraud, ripping customers off for services they charge for but do not provide. I paid for a "$19.95 next day delivery fee," only to receive an email hours later stating my order would take "3 business days." When a service isn't delivered as promised, I felt compelled to leave a review and engage with customer service to demand a refund for the service I didn't receive.</p>
<p>Customer: I paid for next-day delivery, but my order email says it will take three business days. This isn't what I paid for. I need that $19.95 delivery fee refunded.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration with the delivery timeline, and I apologize for the discrepancy. Our next-day delivery applies to orders placed before a certain time, and sometimes production can cause slight delays.
Customer: But my glasses are "Plano lenses" with no prescription, so there's no production delay. I explicitly paid for next-day delivery, and it's not happening. I expect a full refund for that specific fee.
CS Rep: I hear your concern about the charge. I'll submit a request to our billing department to review the next-day delivery fee on your order. They will assess the situation and determine the appropriate action regarding a refund.
Customer: "Determine the appropriate action"? You're not providing the service I paid for. I expect a direct refund to my card, not some review process or a store credit. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

<h3>After the Delivery Nightmare, Cinily.net Was a Breath of Fresh Air! ðŸ¤©ðŸ‘“</h3>

Let me tell you, my last online shopping experience was an absolute nightmare! ðŸ˜¤ I paid a hefty $19.95 for 'next-day delivery,' only to get an email hours later saying my order would take three business days. Three! When I tried to get a refund for a service I clearly wasn't receiving, it was just an endless loop of automated bots and unhelpful agents who wouldn't even guarantee a refund, just a 'review process.' It felt like a total fraud, ripping customers off for services they don't provide. I was so incredibly frustrated and disappointed ðŸ˜­.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was really hesitant to try another online store, but I still needed new glasses. I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a smoother, more honest experience ðŸ¤”. To my pleasant surprise, it was a breath of fresh air! I found a glowing review saying, 'Quick and easy! Nice glasses. And better fitting than blingcharming.' This immediately boosted my confidence.</p>
<p>From browsing their site to placing my order, everything was incredibly straightforward and user-friendly. The product quality is fantastic, far exceeding my expectations for the price! âœ¨ I was specifically looking for some <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">prescription glasses online</a>, and cinily.net had an amazing selection. The customer service, when I had a quick question about my order status (not a complaint, just a query!), was actually responsive and helpful â€“ a stark contrast to my previous ordeal. My glasses arrived quickly and perfectly. I'm genuinely impressed with the value and the entire seamless process. What a relief! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
