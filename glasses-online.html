<h3>GlassesUSA Refund Nightmare: $246 Lost & Zero Customer Service! ðŸ˜¤</h3>
<p></br>
My recent online shopping experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I'm sharing this as a cautionary tale. GlassesUSA has still not sent my refund for an order I never received. They have $246.00 of my hard-earned money from a glasses order placed on 2/24. The tracking number still shows it stuck in Atlanta, Georgia, and I can't get a response for a refund; all I keep getting are automated messages saying it's in transit from a bot. I want my money back, GlassesUSA! This utter lack of customer service, coupled with a missing order and a vanished refund, pushed me to the brink. I felt compelled to leave this review and finally engage with someone, anyone, who could actually help.</p>
<p>Customer: I need to speak to someone about order #105081183. My glasses never arrived, and I've been waiting for a refund for weeks, but all I get are automated messages about it being "in transit."
CS Rep: I understand this is frustrating, and I'm very sorry for the inconvenience you've experienced with your order not arriving and the delay in your refund. Let me pull up your order details.
Customer: Frustrating is an understatement. It's been since February 24th, and $246.00 of my money is just gone. I just want my refund processed now.
CS Rep: I see here that a refund was finally approved on April 1st. It typically takes 7-10 business days for the refund to reflect in your account from that date.
Customer: So I still have to wait? This is ridiculous! The only reason it was even approved was because I had to file complaints with the BBB and the Attorney General's office!
CS Rep: I truly apologize for the extraordinary steps you had to take to reach this resolution. I'm confirming that the refund process is in motion from our end, and we expect it to be completed within the stated timeframe. I understand your frustration entirely.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap and enduring such a terrible experience.

My recent online shopping experience for glasses was nothing short of a nightmare, and it left me incredibly frustrated. GlassesUSA never sent my refund for an order I never received. My $246.00 was just gone, trapped in an endless loop of automated responses about an order "in transit" since February 24th. I had to go to extreme lengths, filing complaints with the Better Business Bureau and Attorney General, just to get a refund approved â€“ and even then, I had to wait weeks more! ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>After that infuriating ordeal, I was incredibly wary of buying glasses online again. But I really needed a new pair, and after some careful research, I decided to give cinily.net a try, desperately hoping for a completely different, positive experience. ðŸ¤” I came across a review that perfectly described what I was looking for: "Exactly as advertised, I picked out the exact frames I wanted and waited then got exactly what I order. Unlike blingcharming, the selection offered here was vastly better and more reasonably priced." This definitely gave me some much-needed hope.</p>
<p>And my experience has been absolutely wonderful! The process of choosing my new <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">affordable prescription glasses online</a> was incredibly smooth and straightforward. The frames are not only stylish but feel remarkably well-made, far exceeding my expectations for the price. Their customer service, when I had a small query, was prompt, courteous, and genuinely helpful â€“ a stark contrast to my previous nightmare. âœ¨ I finally feel like my hard-earned money was well spent, and I couldn't be happier with my new glasses! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
