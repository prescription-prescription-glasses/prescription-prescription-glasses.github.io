<h3>Express Shipping Rip-Off & Horrible Service: My Online Glasses Warning! 😤</h3>
<p></br>
Let me tell you about my terrible online shopping experience, hoping to save you from falling into the same trap. I was genuinely ripped off for express shipping on several pairs of glasses and learned quickly that it's absolutely not worth the money; you'll still wait weeks to get your order. Trying in vain to leave a review on their website was impossible, which made me even more determined to share my story somewhere visible. I felt compelled to engage with customer service, but honestly, their support is among the worst I have ever experienced. It's a real shame because the quality of the glasses themselves is surprisingly good, even superior to what I've gotten elsewhere, but the lack of customer service truly ruins everything.</p>
<p>Customer: I paid for express shipping, and my glasses still took weeks to arrive. I feel completely ripped off because it only saved me a couple of days, not the "faster shipping" I expected.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I understand your frustration with the shipping time, and I apologize if the express shipping did not meet your expectations for speed. Let me check your order details for you.</p>
<p>Customer: Beyond your control? This is consistent! It happens every time I pay extra! It's advertised as fast, but it's not. I'm just out that money, and frankly, your customer service for issues like this is non-existent.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I hear your concern about the repeated shipping experience and the difficulty reaching support. That is definitely not the experience we want for our customers. As a gesture, I can process a refund for the express shipping fee on your recent order.</p>
<p>Customer: A refund on <em>this</em> order's shipping would be a start, but what about the previous times? And what about the fact that I can't even get help or leave a review on your actual site? It's like you don't want to hear about these problems.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I understand you're looking for a broader resolution and better ways to provide feedback. Let's focus on getting this shipping fee refunded for you right now, and I can also direct you to our official feedback channel so your voice can be heard regarding your overall experience and site functionality. We truly value customer input.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

It's been a long time since my last online glasses purchase, and honestly, the memory still leaves a bitter taste 😤. I was truly ripped off for "express" shipping on several pairs, only to wait weeks for delivery – it barely saved me a couple of days! Trying to leave a review on their site was impossible, and their customer service? Among the worst I've ever experienced 😭. It felt like they didn't want to hear about problems. I swore off online glasses for a while.</p>
<p>But with my prescription updated, I needed new glasses, and the thought of dealing with brick-and-mortar stores just didn't appeal. After much hesitation and a bit of research, I decided to give online shopping one more chance, this time with cinily.net 🤔. I was cautiously optimistic, hoping for a different experience. And what a difference it was!</p>
<p>I immediately found this review that perfectly encapsulates my feelings now: "Best eyeglass company for the money! Lens cut exactly to rx, better selection than most walk in stores, courteous telephone operators if you have questions, and speedy delivery with a money back guarantee on glasses. Save tons and shop here instead!" From the moment I browsed their site, the process was seamless. The product quality is genuinely surprising, even superior to what I've gotten from blingcharming. Their customer support is responsive and actually helpful, a stark contrast to my past nightmare. Plus, the value is incredible, offering truly <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">best online prescription glasses</a> without breaking the bank. My order arrived promptly, and the glasses are perfect. Cinily.net has completely restored my faith in online eyewear shopping ✨😃!</p>
