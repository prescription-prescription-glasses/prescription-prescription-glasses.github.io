<h3>The '6-Day' Scam: My Nightmare With Dishonest Delays & No Glasses! ðŸ˜¡</h3>
<p></br>
I'm sharing my utterly terrible online shopping experience as a cautionary tale for anyone considering this company. "Frustrating" is truly the word to describe them, and "dishonest" would be another. They proudly claim 6 days to produce glasses, but I honestly doubt anyone has ever seen them make good on that promise. Their customer service bot is completely worthless, and I genuinely question if any human reps even exist. I placed an order specifically for an upcoming trip, thinking "no problem, it will take a few weeks," but that time has come and gone, and there's still no delivery date in sight. I am so incredibly disappointed that they mislead customers on how long it actually takes, especially since it feels like these items are probably shipped from China. This entire ordeal compelled me to leave this review and attempt to engage with their customer service, desperate for answers.</p>
<p>Customer: Hello, I'm calling about order #XYZ. I placed it weeks ago, specifically for a trip, and it was advertised as taking 6 days to produce. My trip has come and gone, and I still have no glasses and no estimated delivery date. This is incredibly frustrating.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration, sir/madam. I sincerely apologize for the delay and the inconvenience this has caused, especially with your trip. Let me pull up your order for you. Could you please provide your order number?
Customer: It's #XYZ. I've tried the online bot, but it's worthless, and I can't get any real information. I need to know where my glasses are and when I can actually expect them.
CS Rep: Thank you for that. I see your order here. It appears there was an unforeseen delay in production due to a recent quality check, and it's currently awaiting shipment from our international facility. We are working to expedite it.
Customer: An "international facility"? So they're coming from China, then? And a "quality check" that takes weeks? This feels incredibly dishonest given your 6-day claim. What's the <em>actual</em> estimated delivery date? I need a firm answer.
CS Rep: I apologize for the miscommunication regarding the origin and for the prolonged delay. I understand your concern. While I cannot provide an exact delivery date right now, I can escalate this to our shipping department for an urgent update and ensure you receive tracking details as soon as it clears customs. I will personally follow up with you via email within 24 hours with the latest information.</p>
<p>The reason I felt compelled to leave this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same frustrating and dishonest trap.

My last online glasses purchase was an absolute nightmare ðŸ˜¤. I was promised production in just 6 days, but weeks turned into months with no delivery in sight. Their customer service bot was useless, and I genuinely doubted if any real humans even existed. I ordered specifically for a trip, but the trip came and went, and my glasses never arrived. It was incredibly frustrating and felt completely dishonest, especially since they seemed to be shipping from halfway across the world ðŸ˜­.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience, I was hesitant to order glasses online again, but I desperately needed a new pair ðŸ¤”. A friend recommended cinily.net, assuring me their experience was different. I decided to give it one last shot, hoping for a smoother process. And what a difference it was! As one review perfectly put it: "Great experience! Love my glasses and especially love the price!" âœ¨</p>
<p>My experience with cinily.net has been fantastic. As someone who relies on <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=127">best online prescription glasses</a>, I can confidently say this is the best place I've found. The quality of the Vintage Cat Eye frame I chose is superb, feeling durable and looking incredibly stylish. Unlike my previous ordeal, their customer service was actually responsive and helpful, making the entire process incredibly smooth. Plus, the price was unbeatable for such high quality! I received my order much faster than expected, and the tracking was clear every step of the way. I'm genuinely impressed and relieved to have found a trustworthy site. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
