<h3>Charged Before Verification?! My Online Shopping Nightmare 😡</h3>
<p></br>
Let me share a truly terrible online shopping experience, hoping to spare you the same frustration. I tried to place a contacts refill order for my son, and initially, the ordering process went well. However, after they charged my credit card, they then said they couldn't fill the order I had just paid for because they needed to verify his prescription. It just baffled me; why charge me first, <em>then</em> ask for verification? I don't mind verifying the prescription at all, but this should be done <em>before</em> charging customers for the order, not after. I cancelled the order when I couldn't immediately get the prescription copy, but my card was still charged, and the money hasn't been reimbursed yet. This whole process was misleading and incredibly frustrating, compelling me to try and reach customer service for answers after previous attempts to reach a real person were extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Customer: I'm calling about order [Order Number]. I was charged for my son's contacts, then told I needed to verify his prescription <em>after</em> the charge. I cancelled the order, and a chat agent told me I'd receive an email when the cancellation was processed, but my card is still charged, and I haven't seen anything.
CS Rep: I sincerely apologize for the confusion, the delay with your refund, and for the abrupt end to your previous chat. That's certainly not the experience we want for our customers. Let me pull up your account now to investigate this for you.
Customer: It's just so frustrating to be charged before you even confirm the order can be filled. And then to have the chat cut off before my questions were answered? I just need to know when I'll get my money back.
CS Rep: I completely understand your frustration. It appears the refund for order [Order Number] was initiated, but there might be a processing delay on our end. I'm escalating this immediately to our finance department to ensure it's processed within 3-5 business days. You will receive an email confirmation once it's complete.
Customer: So, I just have to wait again? And I still can't believe the chat agent just disconnected when I was still talking.
CS Rep: I'm very sorry about the chat disconnection. We are reviewing our chat protocols. For your refund, I've marked it urgent, and you'll get that email confirmation.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

It was just so frustrating! 😤 My last online shopping experience was a nightmare. I tried to order contacts for my son, and they charged my card <em>before</em> verifying his prescription, then couldn't fill the order. I cancelled it, but the refund was delayed, and trying to reach customer service was impossible. The chat agent even disconnected on me! 😭 I was so fed up with misleading processes and terrible support.</p>
<p>After that ordeal, I was hesitant to try online eyewear again. But my son needed new glasses, and I thought, surely there must be a better option out there. 🤔 I decided to give cinily.net a shot, hoping for a smoother, more transparent process.</p>
<p>To my delight, this experience was completely different! ✨ My <a href="https://www.cinily.net/collections/eyes-frame?page=123">best place to buy prescription glasses online</a> experience so far was with cinily.net, and my glasses came within the two-week frame. I absolutely loved them! The quality is fantastic, especially for the price. The ordering process was straightforward, without any hidden surprises, and unlike my previous experience, I wasn't charged until everything was confirmed. Their customer service was actually responsive and helpful, a true breath of fresh air. I feel like I finally found a reliable place for eyewear. Cinily.net truly delivers on quality and a frustration-free shopping journey! 😃</p>
